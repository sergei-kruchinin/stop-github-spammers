# Stop GH Spammers

Stop GH Spammers is a tool for detecting and dealing with dishonest followers on GitHub.

## Description

On GitHub, there is an issue where users follow you, you reciprocate, and then they unfollow you to increase their follower count. Cleaning up these dishonest followers can be a challenging task, so we created a small program to help with this.

## Installation

1. Obtain a GitHub Token:
    - Go to your GitHub account settings.
    - Create a new Personal Access Token with profile read and write permissions.
    - Copy the created token.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sergei-kruchinin/stop-gh-spamers
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd stop-gh-spamers
    ```

4. Create a `config.py` file and add your GitHub token and username to it:
    ```env
    GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_github_api_acces_token'
    USERNAME = 'your_github_user-name'
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `gh-follow.py` script:
    ```sh
    python3 gh-follow.py
    ```

2. The program will display:
    - Those who have followed you but you have not followed back.
    - Those you are following but who have not followed you back.
   
3. The program will also make predictions on whether a user is a spammer based on their followers-to-following ratio.

4. Evaluate for yourself if a user is a spammer. If it is obvious:
   - Unfollow the user.
   - File a report:
     1. Go to the user's profile and select "Block or report user".
     2. Choose "Report".
     3. Select the reason "Spam or inauthentic Activity" (Inauthentic use of the service such as rank abuse, star abuse, the use of bots, fake accounts or other deceptive uses of the service.
     5. Fill the field with report text like this:
        ```plaintext
        The user is inflating his rating.
        He follows others, and when he gets a follow back, he unfollows.
        As a result, he appears to be an influential developer, but this is deceptive.
        ```
